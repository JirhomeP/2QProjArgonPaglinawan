<h1>Butterfly</h1>
<p>The butterfly is a swimming stroke swum on the chest with both arms moving at the same time, accompanied by the butterfly, also called as dolphin, kick.</p>
<p>For many swimmers, butterfly is the hardest stroke to perform, as it requires more muscles firing at any one time.</p>
<p>In terms of speed, it's peak speed is higher than that of the other strokes.</p>
<p>Even if it's peak speed is high, the recovery speed is slow, which makes it overall speed still lower than the front crawl.</p>
